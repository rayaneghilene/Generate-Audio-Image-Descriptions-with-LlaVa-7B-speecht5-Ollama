 The image shows a road sign that is typically used to indicate the presence of speed limits. The text on the sign reads "STOP" at the top, followed by "SPEED LIMIT 25" in bold letters. Below the speed limit, there is an additional note stating "LIMIT 25", indicating the maximum speed allowed in that area. The background includes a suburban setting with trees, grass, and what appears to be a residential street. There is also a red stop sign visible at the bottom of the image.
